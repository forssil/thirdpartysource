\class ODPCMAliasBlockFile
\brief ODPCMAliasBlockFile is a special type of PCMAliasBlockFile that does not necessarily have summary data available
The summary is eventually computed and written to a file in a background thread.

Load On-Demand implementation of the AliasBlockFile for PCM files.

to load large files more quickly, we take skip computing the summary data and put
ODPCMAliasBlockFiles in the sequence as place holders.  A background thread loads and
computes the summary data into these classes.
ODPCMAliasBlockFiles are unlike all other BlockFiles are not immutable (for the most part,) because when NEW
summary data is computed for an existing ODPCMAliasBlockFile we save the buffer then and write the Summary File.

All BlockFile methods that treat the summary data as a buffer that exists in its BlockFile
are implemented here to behave when the data is not available yet.

Some of these methods have been overridden only because they used the unsafe wxLog calls in the base class.
